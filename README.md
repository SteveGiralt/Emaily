Welcome to Emaily!

This is a service that allows users to send bulk emails to their users for obtaining feedback, taking surveys, and more!

Emaily is written using MongoDB, React, Redux, Node, and Express.

- Using environment variables and a local proxy I am able to run a development server locally before pushing into production
- I have this project hosted on Heroku at https://polar-scrubland-16313.herokuapp.com/

Payments handled by Stripe - users purchase credits which they then use to send email campaigns.
Email handled by Send Grid
User authentication with Passport using Google Sign In.

I learned a ton working on this project, in particular some patterns that I can use in future projects I have planned.
